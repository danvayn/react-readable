## The Readable App - a reddit clone

This app was submitted as completion of the second project in Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree course.

### Instructions
1. `git clone` this app and `cd` into it in Terminal.
2. Open both folders in the repo ('api-server' and 'client') in separate tabs  of Terminal.
3. Run `npm install` in both tabs
4. Run `npm start` in both tabs

That's it!

### How to use
- Navigate from root (`/`) to other pages on Readable like Category (`/:category`), Post submit (`/submit`), and Post details (`/:category/:postID`).
- Try submitting a post to see post validation. On submission, you will be taken to the category that you submitted your post to.
- Try visiting a random URL to see the 404 page.
- Use the User changer in the bottom to switch users. You must be the same user as the author of a piece of content in order to see the edit and delete buttons.
- Vote up or down a post or comment to see how the reddit-inspired voting functionality works. Just don't refresh or you'll lose the ability to see who made what votes.
