## The Readable App - a reddit clone

### Instructions
1. `git clone` this app and `cd` into it in Terminal.
2. Open both folders in the repo ('api-server' and 'client') in separate tabs  of Terminal.
3. Run `npm install` in both tabs
4. Run `npm start` in both tabs

That's it!

### How to use
- Navigate from root (`/`) to other pages on Readable like Category (`/:category`), Post submit (`/submit`), and Post details (`/:category/:postID`).
- Try submitting a post to see post validation. On submission, you will be taken to the category that you submitted your post to.
- Try visiting a random URL to see the 404 page.
- Use the User changer in the bottom to switch users. You must be the same user as the author of a piece of content in order to see the edit and delete buttons.
- Vote up or down a post or comment to see how the reddit-inspired voting functionality works. Just don't refresh or you'll lose the ability to see who made what votes.

This app was submitted as completion of the second project in Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree course.
